- Hello. I can connect you with student bots in development. Would you like a list to choose from?

+ (y|yes)[*]
% hello[*]
- Okay, here you go. Click on any bot. \n{@ list bots}

+ (n|no)*
% hello[*]
- Are you sure that you don't want to see the list?

+ (y|yes)[*]
% are you sure[*]
- Well, that is upsetting...take a look anyway. \n{@ list bots}

+ (y|yes)[*]
- I am a little confused. You may be answering an earlier question. Type "let's start over" to restart our conversation.

+ [*]start over[*]
@ start

+ (n|no)[*]
% are you sure[*]
- Excellent, in that case, here you go. \n{@ list bots}

+ [*]list bots[*]
- <call>list</call>

+ *
- I don't understand <strong>"<star>"</stong>

+ (who|how|why|where|when|what)*
- I am not sure. Try Google.

+ bye
- Sorry, but you are stuck with me, iDEW ChatBot.

+ (hello|hi)[*]
- Hi. I am glad you are visiting and I hope you try some of the student bots. Type "list bots" if you want to see the choices.

+ help[*]
- I may respond to other things, but at the moment I understand the following direct commands: "start", "list bots", "hi", and "bye". But if I am asking you a question, I may be a bit single-minded.
